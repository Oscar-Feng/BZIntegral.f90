# BZIntegral

This package is a Fortran implementation of the recursive hybrid tetrahedron method for Brillouin-zone (BZ) integration. The package is intended to provide systematic solutions to BZ integrals encountered in practical condensed matter calculation that converge slowly due to known singularites. 

A typical BZ integral may look like

$$ \text{Int} = \int d^d k W(\mathbf{k}) F(\mathbf{k}) $$

with a regular part $F(\mathbf{k})$ and a singular weight function $W(\mathbf{k})$. $W(\mathbf{k})$ may be discontinous or divergent in certain place in BZ, which causes poor convergence of integration. Typical examples include

$$ W(\mathbf{k}) = \Theta(\epsilon_F-\varepsilon(\mathbf{k})) $$

$$ W(\mathbf{k}) = \delta(\epsilon_F-\varepsilon(\mathbf{k})) $$

$$ W(\mathbf{k}) = \Theta(\epsilon_F-\varepsilon(\mathbf{k}))\frac{1}{D(\mathbf{k})} $$

$$ W(\mathbf{k}) = \Theta(\epsilon_F-\varepsilon(\mathbf{k}))\delta(D(\mathbf{k})) $$

BZIntegral.f90 takes in values of some interpolable function, e.g. $\varepsilon(\mathbf{k})$ and $D(\mathbf{k})$, on a **regular grid** filling the BZ and returns the integral weights on the same $\mathbf{k}$-grid which can be used to integrate any regular $F(\mathbf{k})$ over the BZ by forming a weighted sum on the regular grid.

Currently three types of singular factors in $W(\mathbf{k})$ are supported: $\Theta(X(\mathbf{k}))$, $\delta(X(\mathbf{k}))$, and $1/D(\mathbf{k})$. Routines that handles $W(\mathbf{k})$ with multiple singular factors are available.
## Compilation
To run a fortran program consist of a series of Fortran files, one need to first complie them by `makefile`, then run the executable file. Some `makefile` examples are given in `Int2d` and `Int3d`.

## Naming convention
The routines in this package are named as 
`Quad*DRule***`
For example, the routine for 

$$ W(\mathbf{k}) = \Theta(\epsilon_F-\varepsilon(\mathbf{k}))$$

in 3D is named 
`Quad3DRuleTheta` 

Symbol "Theta","Delta" and "FrakD" stand for $\Theta(X(\mathbf{k}))$, $\delta(X(\mathbf{k}))$, and $1/D(\mathbf{k})$. And the routine that handles a weight function with multiple singular factors,

$$ W(\mathbf{k}) = \Theta(\epsilon_F-\varepsilon(\mathbf{k}))\frac{1}{D(\mathbf{k})}$$

in 2D is named 
`Quad2DRuleThetaFrakD`

## Usage
Currently, the package provides the following routines:
```
Quad*DRuleTheta,Quad*DRuleDelta,Quad*DRuleThetaFrakD,Quad*DRuleThetaDelta,Quad*DRuleThetaTheta,Quad*DRuleThetaThetaFrakD,Quad*DRuleDeltaDelta,Quad*DRuleThetaThetaDelta
```

A typical routine with header
```
subroutine Quad3DRuleTheta(Emesh,eF,iter=2)
```
is described as 
```
Recursive tetrahedron method for weight function W(k) = Î˜(eF-E(k))
``` 
in documented description, and we call it as
```
Wmesh = Quad3DRuleTheta(Emesh,eF,iter)
```
The variable `Emesh` and `Wmesh` should be 3D-Arrays with odd number of entres in each dimension. They correspond to values on a mesh filling the BZ with open boundary condition (OBC), points on one boundary are identified with points on the oppsite boundary in case of periodic boundary condition (PBC).

And with $F(\mathbf{k})$ sampled on the same grid `Fmesh`, the integral can be calculated as 
```
res = sum(Fmesh*Wmesh)*vol
```
where the first `*` stands for an element-wise product,

`vol` is the volume of BZ.

`iter` is the variable that controls the number of grid refinements. If the algorithm is working properly, we should expect similar accuracy of results using $N\times N \times N$ grid and `iter=n` with that using $2^nN\times 2^nN \times 2^nN$ and `iter=0`. Thus with larger `iter`, we can reproduce results on a dense grid without our recursive refinement using a considerably coarse grid.

## Parallelism
The package has been parallelled using `Openmp`, which is an application programming interface that supports multi-platform shared-memory multiprocessing programming in C, C++, and Fortran.
